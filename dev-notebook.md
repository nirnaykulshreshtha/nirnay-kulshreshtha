## Font Configuration

### Issue
Fonts were not being applied to text elements despite being properly configured in the layout and CSS.

### Root Cause
The fonts were configured correctly in `layout.tsx` using Next.js font optimization:
- Funnel Display (display font) with variable `--display-family`
- Albert Sans (text font) with variable `--text-family`

However, the font classes (`.font-display` and `.font-text`) were missing the `font-family` property in the CSS, and the components weren't using these classes.

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated CSS classes** in `globals.css`:
   - Added `font-family: var(--display-family)` to `.font-display`
   - Added `font-family: var(--text-family)` to `.font-text`
   - Applied `font-text` as default to body element

2. **Applied font classes** in `page.tsx`:
   - Added `font-display` class to h1 element
   - Added `font-text` class to p element

### Font Setup Architecture
- **Display Font**: Funnel Display (700 weight) - Used for headings
- **Text Font**: Albert Sans (400 weight) - Used for body text
- **CSS Variables**: `--display-family` and `--text-family` are set in layout.tsx
- **Utility Classes**: `.font-display` and `.font-text` apply the fonts with proper weights

### Usage
- Use `font-display` class for headings and display text
- Use `font-text` class for body text and paragraphs
- The body element automatically uses `font-text` as default

### Notes
- Tailwind CSS v4 is being used with `@theme` directives in CSS
- Fonts are optimized using Next.js `next/font/google`
- Font variables are applied to the HTML element for global access

- **Subtlety**: Animations enhance rather than distract from content

## Image Handling

### Next.js Image Component Usage
- Images in the `public` directory should be referenced without the `./public/` prefix
- Correct: `src={'/nirnay.png'}`
- Incorrect: `src={'./public/nirnay.png'}`

### Image Optimization
- Use `priority` prop for above-the-fold images
- Add `className` for styling (rounded-full, shadow-lg, etc.)
- Always provide proper `alt` text for accessibility

### Common Issues
- **Invalid URL Error**: Occurs when using relative paths with `./public/` prefix
- **Solution**: Remove the `./public/` prefix and reference directly from root

## Container Configuration

### Custom Container Utilities
The project uses custom container utilities defined in `globals.css` using Tailwind CSS v4's `@theme` directive with utility objects.

### Available Container Utilities
- **`container`**: Default container with responsive max-width and padding
- **`container-sm`**: Max-width 640px
- **`container-md`**: Max-width 768px
- **`container-lg`**: Max-width 1024px
- **`container-xl`**: Max-width 1280px
- **`container-2xl`**: Max-width 1536px
- **`container-tight`**: Reduced padding (0.5rem)
- **`container-wide`**: Increased padding (2rem)
- **`container-full`**: No max-width (full width)

### CSS Variables
- `--container-padding`: 1rem (default horizontal padding)
- `--container-max-width`: 1200px (default max-width)

### Usage Examples
```html
<!-- Default container -->
<div class="container">Content</div>

<!-- Small container -->
<div class="container container-sm">Narrow content</div>

<!-- Container with tight padding -->
<div class="container container-tight">Compact content</div>

<!-- Full width container -->
<div class="container container-full">Full width content</div>
```
