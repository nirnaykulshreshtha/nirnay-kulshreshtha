## Dock Component Responsive Design (2024-06-09)

- **Change:** The Dock navigation bar is now fully responsive.
  - **Mobile (width < 768px):**
    - Dock is always fixed to the bottom (`fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 w-full`).
    - Full-width, no rounded corners, border at the top.
    - Larger icon size and spacing for easier touch interaction.
    - Reduced magnification effect for icons (less distracting on touch).
  - **Desktop (width >= 768px):**
    - Dock is floating, centered, with rounded corners and magnifying icons.
    - Behaves as before.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used Tailwind responsive classes in `dockVariants` for layout and style changes.
  - Icon size, magnification, and distance are set based on screen width.
  - All changes are documented in the Dock file and here for future reference.
- **Rationale:**
  - Improves mobile UX by making navigation always accessible and touch-friendly.
  - Maintains the desktop experience users expect.
